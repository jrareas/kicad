Op-Amp/Comparator Macromodels
Performance parameters incorporated in models are based primarily on measured performance as taken from bench tests and production run averages, and secondarily on split between data sheet MIN/MAX parameter values. Macromodels are intended as an aid for design and prototyping. Industry standard macromodels for op-amps and comparators, including those supplied by Maxim, are based on simplified circuit expressions, and/or replacement of active circuit elements with ideal controlled voltage and current sources. As such, simulation with macromodels should not be relied upon as final proof-of-design. Use of macromodel descriptions is not a substitute for worst-case design analysis, nor for testing real circuits over temperature, supply, and other operating limits.

Op-Amps and Comparators are grouped into families with similar characteristics. These families appear in files named MAXxxx.FAM where MAXxxx is the first part number of the family.
